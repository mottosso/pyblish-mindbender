### Install

```bash
$ pip install pyblish-mindbender
```

Each studio must then define a few executables with their own local paths, that are later mapped into the pipeline automatically.

<br>

### Usage

```python
>>> from pyblish_mindbender import api, maya
>>> api.install(maya)
```

<br>

### Documentation

While developing the documentation, here is how you can run a local Jekyll server that will enable you to preview what the website will look like locally.

```bash
$ cd pyblish-mindbender
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/docs:/src -p 4000:4000 grahamc/jekyll serve -w --force_polling -H 0.0.0.0
```

The server will now be available at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`. Make sure port `4000` is forwarded to your host.

### Testing

```bash
cd pyblish-mindbender
docker build -t pyblish/mindbender -f Dockerfile-maya2016 .

# Run nosetests (Windows)
docker run --rm -v %cd%:/workspace pyblish/mindbender

# Run nosetests (Linux/OSX)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace pyblish/mindbender
```

### Code convention

Below are some of the standard practices applied to this repositories.

- **PEP8**
 	- All code is written in PEP8. It is recommended you use a linter as you work, flake8 and pylinter are both good options.
- **Napoleon docstrings**
	- Any docstrings are made in Google Napoleon format. See [Napoleon](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for details.
- **Semantic Versioning**
	- This project follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).
- **Underscore means private**
	- Anything prefixed with an underscore means that it is internal to wherever it is used. For example, a variable name is only ever used in the parent function or class. A module is not for use by the end-user. In contrast, anything without an underscore is public, but not necessarily part of the API. Members of the API resides in `api.py`.
